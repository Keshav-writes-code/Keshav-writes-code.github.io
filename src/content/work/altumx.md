Three weeks into my AI Engineer internship at AltumX and I'm diving deep into their AI-powered SEO platform. The remote work has been intense but incredibly rewarding.

## What I'm Learning

I'm helping develop NLP models that analyze search intent and content quality across languages. Yesterday's debugging marathon taught me more than any tutorial could! The intersection of AI and SEO is fascinating - especially seeing how transformer models can understand contextual relationships in content.
