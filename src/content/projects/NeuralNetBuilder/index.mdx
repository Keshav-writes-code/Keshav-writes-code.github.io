1. This was a Passion Project when i was Learning About Neural Nets.
2. **My Goal** with this Project was to be able to Play Around with all the Parameters of a MLP (Weights, Biases, Activation Functions, Layers Count, etc) with a 2 dimensional Neural Net to see the changes i make to the parameters in real time on a 2D Graph and develop a Deeper Intuition about Various Components of a MultiLayer Perceptron
